# NIRCam GitHub Training Repository

This repository contains fake code that can be used to practice GitHub commands and
workflows. This repository is purely for training purposes.
This has been fun. Thanks eveyone!



### Recommended instructions for contributing code to a repo:

1. Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of this page to create a fork off of the `nircam-training` repository.
2. Make a local clone of your fork (click the green "Clone" button).
   * using SSH (`git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/nircam-training.git`)
   * using HTTPS (`git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/nircam-training.git`)
3. Change directories to the `nircam-training` directory: `cd nircam-training`
4. Run the setup script: `python setup.py install`
5. Make sure your fork is pointing to the right places: `git remote -v`  You should see:

    `origin	git@github.com:<your_username>/nircam-training.git (fetch)`

    `origin	git@github.com:<your_username>/nircam-training.git (push)`

    If that is not what you see, type:

    `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<your_username>/nircam-training.git`.

6. Make sure your fork is pointing upstream properly by typing:

    `git remote add upstream git@github.com:spacetelescope/nircam-training.git`

    You should see:

    `upstream	git@github.com:spacetelescope/nircam-training.git (fetch)`

    `upstream	git@github.com:spacetelescope/nircam-training.git (push)`

7. Create a branch on your personal fork: `git checkout -b <branch_name>`
8. Make your software changes and then stage them: `git add changed_file.py`
9. Commit your new file with a description of the change: `git commit -m "Made a change"`
10. Push that branch to your personal GitHub repository (i.e. `origin`):

    `git push origin <branch_name>`

11. On the `spacetelescope` `nircam-training` repository, create a pull request to merge your changes into `spacetelescope:master`.
12. Assign a reviewer from the team for the pull request.
13. Delete your local copy of your branch.
